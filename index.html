                        <h3>About the Book</h3>
                        <p>Trevor Noah's Born a Crime is a memoir about growing up in South Africa during the end
                             of apartheid. Born to a Black mother and White father, his mixed-race birth was illegal,
                              making him an outsider from the start. The book tells stories of his life in tough neighborhoods,
                               dealing with poverty, prejudice, and violence. His bold, loving mom, Patricia, guides him with lessons 
                               on resilience and independence. With humor and heart, Noah shares how he navigated a divided society, 
                               offering a moving look at family, identity, and finding hope in hard times.</p>

                <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
                <blockquote>"Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he never fell in love with subservient women… 'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.'"</blockquote>
                <p>This line grabbed me—it’s not just Abel’s story. It’s about how guys and girls connect today.</p>
                <h4>Abel’s Mixed-Up Wants</h4>
                <p>Abel loves Patricia’s strength—she’s tough, smart, and does her own thing. But he also wants her to act like a “classic” wife, following his lead. That “cage” part? It means he likes her freedom but wants to control it. I see this now. Some guys online say they want a cool, driven girlfriend but get upset if she’s too busy with her own goals.I have some guy friends who bragged about their girfriend's special skills but got mad when they give time to them selfes, saying they didn’t “care enough.” It’s like wanting a star but dimming their light.</p>
                <h4>Why This Matters</h4>
                <p>The quote shows old ideas about guys and girls can hurt people. Abel’s need to be in charge turns ugly, breaking their family. We still see this—guys expected to be “the boss,” girls to “help out.” It’s messy. Patricia’s fight to stay herself makes me want love that’s fair, where no one’s trapped.</p>

                        <p>If I could give the book a title I would have named it <span class="book-title">Stuck Between, Still Strong</span></p>
                        <h4>Why this name</h4>
                        <p>This title shows Trevor’s life—caught between black and white worlds in apartheid South Africa, never quite fitting in, but always pushing through with guts and laughs. “Stuck Between” covers how he’s seen as “wrong” for being mixed-race, like when he hides his mom’s role or hustles to get by. “Still Strong” highlights how he stays true to himself, becoming a bold voice. </p>
